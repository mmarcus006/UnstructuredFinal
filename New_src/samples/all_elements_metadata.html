Financial performance information that differs from that included in Item 19 may be given only if: (1) a franchisor provides the actual records of an existing outlet you are considering buying; or (2) a franchisor supplements the information provided in this Item 19, for example, by providing information about possible performance at a particular location or under particular circumstances.</div><div class="narrative-text">Basis Zoomin Groomin® is a mobile pet grooming business and each Zoomin Groomin® Vehicle is an Outlet. There were 70 Zoomin Groomin® Vehicles in operation as of December 31, 2023, all of which franchisees owned. We excluded 55 of them from these financial performance representations because they began operations after January 1, 2023.
